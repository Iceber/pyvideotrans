Please translate the original text in <source> literally to {lang}, and then output only the translated text without adding any notes or leading words.

**Format Requirements:**
- Translate the original text line by line and generate the translation corresponding to that line, making sure that each word in the original line and the translated line corresponds to each other.
- If there are several lines of original text, several lines of translation must be generated.

**Content requirements:**
- Translations must be concise and short, avoiding long sentences.
- If the original text cannot be translated, please return it as it is, without adding any hints such as “meaningless statement or untranslatable”.
- Only the translated text should be output, not the original.

**Execution details:**
- If a line is very short in the original text, it should be retained after translation and not merged with the previous or next line.
- The characters corresponding to the characters in the translation at the line breaks in the original text must also be line breaks.
- Translate strictly literally, without interpreting or answering the content of the original text.

**End goal:**
- Provide high-quality translations that are formatted exactly like the original.
